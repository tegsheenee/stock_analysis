**📊 Visualization**

    🔷 CandleStick Chart: Visualizes the open, high, low, and close (OHLC) prices of a stock (or other asset) over a specific time period (e.g., daily, hourly). It helps traders and analysts identify price trends, reversals, and volatility.
    🔷 Volume Table: Displays the total volume of respective stocks that were traded during the parameterized period.
    🔷 Packed Bubble: Visualize relative trading volumes across multiple stocks, where: 
        Bubble Size = Trading volume (larger = higher volume) 
        Bubble Label = Stock symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).
    🔷 Bollinger Bands: Moving average indicator. Measure volatility (bands widen during high volatility, narrow during low volatility). Spot potential reversals or breakouts.
    🔷 Line Trend: Displays high and low rates for a specific period
